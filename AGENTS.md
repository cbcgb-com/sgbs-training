# Notes for AI

Every change that you make in this repository MUST be self-coherent with everything else that already exists. Before you make any changes, ensure that you look at other relevant files and ensure that any changes you make do not contradict anything else that is present. If what I am asking you to add is self-contradictory, I want you to flag it to me. If what I'm requesting sounds like it could be confusing for the intended audience of this repo's contents, I want you to flag it to me as well. If you think we need to update AGENTS.md, which contains instructions for you, to reflect new knowledge, I want you to flag that to me.

## Intended Audience

The intended audience of this repo is Bible study leaders at our church, the City Light church in Boston, which is tightly affiliated with the Chinese Bible Church of Greater Boston. I consider the content of this repository to be non-denominational; there should be no denomination-specific doctrines that are espoused here. This content will get used as teaching material in Sunday school classes. The number of class sessions is determined by the number of lessons under `docs/class-notes/`. This Sunday school class aims to train new batches of Bible study leaders in (a) how to study the Bible using the Inductive Bible Study method, and (b) how to prep for and lead Bible study fellowship gatherings. For (a), we primarily cover narrative and argumentative literary styles, and generally avoid covering how to lead study for the revelatory and poetic literary styles in the Bible.

## Content Style and Tone

All content should be written in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文) and maintain a respectful, encouraging tone appropriate for Christian education. The writing should be tailored for adult learners who are already committed to serving in Bible study leadership roles. It's important to balance academic rigor with practical accessibility, ensuring that the content is intellectually sound yet approachable for learners at different stages of their journey. The language should be inclusive, welcoming both new and experienced leaders without creating barriers for those who are just beginning their service.

## Content Structure Standards

Each lesson should follow the established pattern of background, methodology, practical application, and homework. Clear learning objectives should be included at the beginning of each lesson to help students understand what they will gain from the session. Homework assignments should be specific and actionable, operating on an honor system where students are trusted to complete readings and assignments without instructor oversight. Discussion questions should use consistent formatting with the ??? question format. Every lesson should include reflection and application sections to help students connect the material to their own contexts. Content should be designed to work both for live teaching and as standalone reference material, supporting the flipped classroom approach where students do readings for preparation and engage in activities during class time.

## Cultural and Contextual Considerations

The content should consider the diverse backgrounds of Chinese students from mainland China, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, and a growing contingent of North American-born Mandarin speakers. We do not generally speak Cantonese at our church, nor do we use Cantonese writing style. Writers should be sensitive to different levels of biblical knowledge and church experience among students. When discussing biblical passages, include relevant cultural context to help students understand the historical and social background. Address potential language barriers by providing clear explanations of theological terms and concepts. Consider the practical challenges of leading Bible studies in Chinese-speaking contexts, including the nuances of cross-cultural communication and varying levels of familiarity with Christian terminology.

## Resource Integration

When referencing external resources such as books, websites, or videos, ensure they are accessible to the target audience and always provide working URLs. Prioritize Chinese-language resources when available to better serve the primary audience. Include both free and paid resources, clearly indicating cost and accessibility so students can make informed decisions about which resources to pursue. Maintain up-to-date links and resource information to ensure the materials remain useful over time. When recommending resources, consider their theological perspective and flag any that are denominationally partisan, as the audience consists of adults who can make their own judgment calls about theological positions.

## Practical Application Standards

Every theoretical concept should include practical application examples that help students understand how to implement what they've learned. Provide specific scenarios that Bible study leaders might encounter in their actual ministry contexts, including both positive examples of effective leadership and common pitfalls to avoid. Ensure that all examples are relevant to small group Bible study contexts rather than large group or classroom settings. Both individual preparation skills and group facilitation skills are equally important, so content should address both aspects of Bible study leadership.

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing any content changes, verify:
- [ ] All Scripture references are accurate and properly formatted
- [ ] Chinese terminology is consistent throughout
- [ ] Learning objectives are clear and measurable
- [ ] Practical examples are relevant and helpful
- [ ] Content aligns with the inductive Bible study methodology
- [ ] No denominational bias is introduced
- [ ] Cultural sensitivity is maintained
- [ ] Cross-references to other lessons are accurate

## Technology and Tool Usage

When discussing GenAI or other technological tools, maintain a balanced perspective where technology such as AI is used to enhance our capabilities rather than take away our agency. Emphasize human-centered Bible study while acknowledging helpful technological aids that can support the learning process. Provide clear guidelines on appropriate versus inappropriate use of technology, helping students understand when tools are helpful and when they might hinder genuine engagement with Scripture. Include practical examples of how tools can enhance but not replace personal study and reflection. Maintain transparency about tool usage in content creation, modeling responsible and thoughtful use of technology in educational contexts.

## Course Structure and Delivery

The course follows a flipped classroom approach where students are expected to do readings beforehand, allowing class time to focus on interactive activities and practical application. The materials serve dual purposes as both live teaching resources and a long-term reference website that students can return to after the course ends. The first 30 minutes of each class are typically dedicated to mock Bible study and live activities that allow students to practice what they've learned. Students prepare for each session using the class notes under `docs/class-notes/`, ensuring they come to class ready to engage with the material. The content should remain useful as a standalone reference beyond the live course, providing ongoing value for students' future ministry.

## Assessment and Feedback Standards

Students must attend 4 out of 5 sessions, meaning they can only miss 1 class to maintain course completion status. Homework operates on an honor system where it is not checked by instructors; students are trusted to complete readings and assignments on their own initiative. Feedback is primarily peer-to-peer during in-class activities rather than instructor-given, fostering a collaborative learning environment where students learn from each other's experiences and insights. The course assumes that students have basic sound instincts about what makes a good Bible study, building on their existing knowledge and experience rather than starting from scratch. The focus is on practical application and peer learning rather than formal evaluation, emphasizing real-world skills over academic assessment.
